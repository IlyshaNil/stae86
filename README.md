Simple django app.  

On the home page you may enter data into input and save on the server. After clicking the "send" button, the entered data is sent to the server, and the field is blocked. The "Add Field" button will provide one more (or as many) inputs for data entry. The "Inputs list" button will take you to the page for displaying all entered records in the JSON format
